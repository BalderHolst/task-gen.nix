# Nix Task Generator
A nix library for creating project tasks using nix. These tasks can be embedded into your development shell and can be used to generate makefiles and git hooks.


### Available Functions
!{./document.py ./lib.nix}

### Builtin Tasks
Below is a list of functions to generate common tasks. The list is short for now, but it will grow as i find more tasks that i would like to use across projects. These tasks can be accessed through `task-gen.<system>.lib.tasks`.

!{./document.py ./builtin-tasks.nix}
