# Nix Task Generator
A nix library for creating project tasks using nix. These tasks can be embedded into your development shell and can be used to generate makefiles and git hooks.


### Available Functions
!{./document.py ./lib.nix}

### Task Generators
Below is a list of functions to generate common tasks. The list is short for now, but it will grow as i find more tasks that i would like to use across projects. These tasks can be accessed through `task-gen.<system>.lib.gen`.

!{./document.py ./builtin-tasks.nix}

### Shell Snippets
A collection of shell snippets to be used when generating tasks. They are mostly things i find myself writing often and have to google every time. These are available through `task-gen.<system>.lib.snips`.

!{./document.py ./snippets.nix}
