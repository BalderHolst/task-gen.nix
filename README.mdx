# Nix Task Generator
A nix library for creating project tasks using nix. These tasks can be embedded into your development shell and can be used to generate makefiles and git hooks.

!(python){
    # Generate table-of-content
    import re

    with open("./README.mdx") as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        # Check if line is a heading
        if re.match(r'^#+ ', line):
            line = line.strip()
            (prefix, heading) = line.split(' ', 1)
            if len(prefix) == 1: continue
            print(f"- [{heading}](#{heading.lower().replace(' ', '-')})")
}

## Available Functions
!{./document.py ./lib.nix}

## Task Generators
Below is a list of functions to generate common tasks. The list is short for now, but it will grow as i find more tasks that i would like to use across projects. These tasks can be accessed through `task-gen.<system>.lib.gen`.

!{./document.py ./builtin-tasks.nix}

## Shell Snippets
A collection of shell snippets to be used when generating tasks. They are mostly things i find myself writing often and have to google every time. These are available through `task-gen.<system>.lib.snips`.

!{./document.py ./snippets.nix}
